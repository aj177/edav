## Why Facebook Dropped $19B On WhatsApp - dejunked charts

## The Question:

This blog aims to explain "Why Facebook Dropped $19B On 
WhatsApp"? Based on the data from Onavo and Jana Mobile, the 
author concludes that the main reason is WhatsApp's reach into 
Europe and Emerging markets.

## The Charts

Since the focus of the blog, is WhatsApp's market share vs 
Facebook, I would represent this with a sharp faceted bar plot. 

Alternatively, I would visualize market leadership as a 
choropleth map. In this instance, I used a 5-class sequential, 
ColorBrewer Blue-Green hue and jenks classification. Light blue 
represents fb messenger prevalence while the green scaling 
intensity showcases WhatsApp dominance. 

The current world map chart is kitsch and ineffective owing to:

1) displayof auxiliary messaging apps market share

2) colors of fb messenger and WhatsApp bar plots are 
undiscernable

3) the zoom frames are plain kitsch!

## The Data:

The data for the chart "WhatsApp Extraordinary Growth in Users" 
seems to offer an inappropriate comparison.

In my opinion, WhatsApp user growth should be compared to rival 
messaging apps and not social media networks. Chart 3 reveals the 
growth rate of WeChat in China, the largest smart phone market. 
Did facebook acquire WhatsApp to become a hegemon for WeChat?
